			<h1>Personal Information</h1>

			<br>

			<p>&emsp;I am Ma. Lea Jane D. Medrano I grew up in I was born on February 7, 2002 I am 20 years old I am a college student studying at batangas state university and the course I took was Bs Information Technology I studied senior high school at Ama computer college batangas my parents are Patricia Medrano and Danilo Medrano and I have a sister whose name isLyncel Joyce Medrano.</p>

			<br>

			<p>&emsp;Our state in life is that we live a complete and happy life together in our home. My sister and I grew up well, with respect and obedience. The story of my life is happy and sad there are things or times that will inevitably be a problem in my family or in my life. There are things I will never forget, those with my friends and family. They are the ones who are there whenever I am sad or crying whenever I need someone to talk to and I need someone to talk to whenever I have a problem and always cry. I learned a lot in my life, that is not everything, is, always happy, problems and sadness always dominate more than pleasure, I learned to forgive and be humble. In my life, when there is a problem, I have learned not to talk but to go through the problem and go through it. I learned more and more to always trust in god whether I have a problem or not. When I was a child until now I was closer to my grandmother than my parents why? I also don't know if there are things that I don't really like about my parents' behavior. I'm not angry or I hate them. I love them because they are my parents. They just really have a chance that I am closer to my grandmother. I think my grandmother understands me better than my parents. Do I have a grandfather? Yes there is the case that they are both in heaven.</p> 

			<br>

			<p>&emsp;My sister sometimes agrees with me but we were not always enemies when I was a child and until now I also do not know why we often disagree maybe because we have different habits people often mistake us for twins. Are we twins? We will not just follow. I have a tendency to eat sleep and gadgets. Just my life is sometimes happy and sometimes sad. If there is anything I can thank my parents for and the one they raised me well. Why do I often feel sad? I also do not know that there are things that I can sometimes feel sad and thinking about. Many what if. I always have a lot of questions. What if I have not been successful, what if I am not happy again, what if the people I choose to love always leave me alone, what if my life is pure what if. I also have a lot of question words why? Why is the sadness of life, why did he leave me, why am I living, why is it pure. All the what if or why I have in life, I know that only I can solve. My life not only revolves around sadness and pain there are days when I am very happy with my family laughing my friends who are with me in everything if I have learned anything in my life that is to appreciate what is there and love the self. </p>

			<br>

            <p>&emsp;I have no talent but i can consider it a talent to eat sleep listen to songs and love you sir joke I have many things I want to achieve in life I have many dreams that I want to achieve and fulfill and you are one of them sir joke here is that seriously my dream is to become a nurse I really want to become a nurse that's why the course I took was in IT but as time went by I enjoy this course and I have no regrets for the decisions I chose. My goal is to finish my studies and help my family with all the financial problems we are facing and will face. my family is very important and I love them even though there are times when I don't understand them, I'm a shy girl that's what I don't like about myself being shy even if I try to change or be positive and courageous it still comes to the point where I don't really can't be shy. but I try to do my best to be brave and not be ashamed of anything I do. I'm also an overthinker and that's what I hate. I've also been through failed relationships. I've always been left because of my attitude and that's the reason why I think so low of myself but I can handle it and I've overcome it and I've always been able to handle it. all the problems that will come in my life are important with me God and my family and of course you too sir Hahahahah joke about reaching my dreams and I know that they believe that I can do it so I will trust in myself. That is the story of my life</p>
